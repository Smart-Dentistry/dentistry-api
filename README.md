This is an API to help dentists manage their clinics. This project could be used as a starting point and a guide for projects related to managing a clinic for dentists or medical practitioners.

## Technologies

The main technologies used in this project are:

* [Docker][]
* [PostgreSQL][] (container)
* [Python 3][python] (container)
* [poetry][]
* [Django][]
* [Django REST Framework][DRF]

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

It is assumed you have installed [Git][] and [Docker][] in your machine.

### Creating a gpg RSA key-pair

Install [git-secret][] and [create a gpg RSA key-pair][create-gpg-key].
Send your `public-key.gpg` file to a developer and ask him to
add you to this repository using git-secret.

**Note:** if you are testing this project, or you want to use this project as a starting point, you can skip this step, but make sure to create the files: `env.app` and `env.db`. The content of this files might be as follows:

#### `env.app`

```
DEBUG=1
SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-django-secret-key>
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:user@db:5432/dentistry
SQL_HOST=db
SQL_PORT=5432
DATABASE=postgres
DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE=True
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=<replace-with-bucket-name>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<replace-with-aws-access-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<replace-with-aws-secret-access-key>
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=<replace-with-s3-regin>
```

#### `env.db`

```
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=user
POSTGRES_DB=dentistry
```

### Cloning repository (depends on previous step)

Once you have confirmed that you have been included in the repo using git-secret, clone this repo and navigate inside its root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smart-Dentistry/dentistry-api.git && cd dentistry-api
```

### Decrypting secrets (skip if not using git-secret)

Decrypt the secret files by running the following command:

```python
git secret reveal
```

The previous command will decript two files `.env.app` and `.env.db` which contain environment variables with keys and secrets for configuration.

### Building containers

Build containers:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Starting containers

Start containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Seed database (recommended)

You can populate the database by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec app python manage.py seed
```

You are all set ðŸŽ‰. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/admin/ to see Django's admin login page.

## Adding a new developer

If you are a new developer joining the project,
create a new branch called `new-dev-[username]` and
add yourself as a dict element (`username` and `email`) at the end of the `DEVS` list located at [seed.py][].
(see existing elements in `DEVS`)

Once you have added yourself, commit the changes, push the branch, and create a pull request.

## pre-commit and pre-push

[pre-commit][] is used in order to run some hooks and automate some tasks such as formatting files before committing and running tests before commiting and pushing. Make sure you have [installed pre-commit][install-precommit].

In order to take advantage of the hooks defined at [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`][pre-commit-file], run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install && pre-commit install -t pre-push
```

## Docker commands

This is a compilation of some useful Docker commands.

### Containers commands

#### Build containers

```bash
docker-compose build
```

#### Start containers

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### Stop containers

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

#### Remove containers

```bash
docker-compose rm
```

#### Destroy containers and volumes

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Images commands

#### List images

```bash
docker image ls
```

#### Remove image

```bash
docker image rm dentistry_app
```

### app service

#### Start bash session in python container

```bash
docker-compose exec app bash
```

#### Seed database

```bash
docker-compose exec app seed
```

#### Clear database (keep migrations' table)

```bash
docker-compose exec app flush --no-input
```

#### Start Django shell

```bash
docker-compose exec app python manage.py shell
```

#### Run tests

```bash
docker-compose exec app pytest
```

### Genete test coverage report (run test before)

```bash
docker-compose exec app coverage html
```

You will be able to open up the report at `htmlcov/index.html`
using your favorite browser.

### Generate test coverage shield badge (run tests before)

```bash
docker-compose exec app coverage-badge -f -o coverage.svg
```

This will generate a file `coverage.svg` at the root directory of this project.

### db service

#### Start bash session in postgres container

```bash
docker-compose exec db bash
```
